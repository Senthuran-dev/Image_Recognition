# Image_Recognition

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **"Vision AI in 5 Days" bootcamp**, guiding participants through building an **image recognition model** in Python using deep learning.  
Over the course of five days, the goal is to transform from a beginner into a capable **image classification developer**, creating a deployable, portfolio-ready toolkit that demonstrates skills in **computer vision**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn **image preprocessing** and augmentation techniques.
- Understand **deep learning fundamentals** and **CNN architecture**.
- Train, evaluate, and optimize a convolutional neural network.
- Apply **transfer learning** for improved performance.
- Visualize model performance and interpret results.
- Prepare a professional **GitHub repository** to showcase your skills to recruiters.

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**

## 📂 Dataset
You can use any of the following datasets:
- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [Cats vs Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

**Dataset Preprocessing Steps:**
1. Download and load dataset.
2. Normalize pixel values (0–1 range).
3. Resize images if necessary.
4. Visualize sample images using Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
### **Day 1 — Preprocess & Explore Dataset**
- Load dataset and normalize images.
- Resize and visualize sample images.

### **Day 2 — Build & Train CNN**
- Implement a basic CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Train on dataset and monitor accuracy/loss.

### **Day 3 — Data Augmentation & Evaluation**
- Apply rotation, flipping, and shifting.
- Evaluate with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Plot confusion matrix.

### **Day 4 — Optimize with Transfer Learning**

- Compare performance with custom CNN.

### **Day 5 — Document, Demo & Submit**
- Organize code in scripts.
- Save trained models & plots.
- Create a README, demo video, and presentation.
